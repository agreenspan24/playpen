Playpen
Adam Greenspan

In the above playpen, you will find various projects I have worked on in spare time to test a new coding idea or learn a new skill. It includes:

- A project recreating a phone game called Dots
- A fake, basic presidential campaign website
- An alternative alarm clock
- And a recreation of a favorite news site
