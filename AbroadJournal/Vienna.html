	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Vienna</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: March 28, 2016</i></p>

	<p>Upon arriving to Vienna around 5:30, we headed straight to our hostel, where warm tea and an upgrade to a private room awaited us. Yet we couldn’t enjoy it for that long, as we had to run to go get standing room tickets to the Opera. The guide recommended we get there by 5:30, yet we arrived at 6:45 for a 7:30 show with the hopes they weren’t out of tickets. Though there was a long line, we were able to get gallery tickets for only 3 euros! The Vienna Opera was showing La Boheme by Puccini that night, which is one of the more famous operas out there as well as the basis for the musical Rent. Standing room was packed and it was difficult to find a spot where we could see the stage, but eventually, about halfway through the first act, we found a place where about half the stage and orchestra could be seen, which was good enough for us. Musically, it was incredible to be there. The orchestra is known as the feeder gig for spots in the Vienna Philharmonic, the best orchestra in the world. The singers were superb in their ability to fill up the massive hall. In a sign of progress, the black female lead and female conductor showed that the opera itself was not stuck in the 1800s. Yet the opera house was, built in 1868 and of an ornate internal design. The staircase was particularly stunning. Also seemingly out of the 1800’s were some of the guests, wearing tuxedos and ball gowns indicative of Austrian high society. After being cultured for the night, we crossed the street for a late dinner and read the actual summary of the opera, since we did not have subtitles or a program available to us in standing room. We finished the night at a cafe by our hostel called Mozart’s with some viennese white wine and austrian lemonade.</p>

	<p>The next morning, we got up early to try and pack as much as we could into our only full day in Vienna. We began at Schoenbrunn palace, the summer home of the Habsburg dynasty, whose large gardens upon a hill provided a great view of the city. We entered the imperial apartments of Maria Theresa, whose emperorship caused the war of Austrian succession, as well as those of Franz Josef, who was emperor for 68 years, including for when WWI broke out. Having not satisfied our quench for Habsburg history, we headed to the Hofburg palace in the center of the city, the main residence of the royal family. After walking around the grounds there, we grabbed our taste of weinerschnitzel at a cart by the palace. Next, we walked across the street to the Austrian Parliament building, where we had an interesting tour in both English and Spanish (the guide was tri-lingual and combined the two groups). It was an ornate roman-style building where we got to see the rooms still in use for governmental purposes. There, we found out the Austrian national symbol includes an eagle (a sign of monarchy/empire) and a hammer and sickle (a sign of communism), yet espouses neither of those philosophies. When I asked the guide why this was, he said “we all have a little bit of both communism and capitalism in us.” I was not satisfied by this answer but it will have to do until I do more research. We continued onto Mozarthaus, a museum on the composer’s residence, where I very much enjoyed refreshing my memory on the legend’s life. Before breaking for dinner, we stopped into St. Stephen’s Church, the most prominent and central cathedral in the city. It was past sundown when we reached the gothic giant, so I personally enjoyed the spooky atmosphere of the dark interior. We ate at a local restaurant, where I had cordon bleu, which is essentially weinerschnitzel with ham and cheese stuffed inside. After chatting for a while at the restaurant, we realized there was a jazz bar called Porgy and Bess nearby. Since I can never pass up jazz, we headed over and discovered that we were in fact two hours late to the set (this is the problem with the 24-hour clocks: it’s so easy to mistake 20:30 for 10:30). Yet we caught one and a half songs that made it all worth it. The encore they performed was a chaotic piece with the piano, drum kit, and string bass. The bassist in particular was doing some pretty nasty work on that piece. </p>

	<p>The following morning, we woke up early to do laundry, as we were all on our last set of clean clothes and feeling pretty gross. After the laundry and checking out, we went to Belvedere, a former prince’s palace that now hosts an art museum. Marian showed off her knowledge of art as we saw a gallery of Gustaf Klimt, a Viennese artist famous for the painting “The Kiss.” We finished up at a local market before heading to our bus to Budapest, ending our whirlwind 48 hours in Vienna. Overall, I was a big fan of Vienna and it would probably be the first of the places I would return to should I get the chance. It was bursting with culture and life and seemed to combine the city, historical, and cultural elements I liked of Prague and Berlin. While I wish we had more time to explore, we packed a lot into two days and it was nice being in what was for many years the cultural capital of Europe.</p>
