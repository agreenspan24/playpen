	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Dublin</h2>
	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: February 21, 2016</i></p>
	<p>Finally, the following weekend, I went to Dublin. The idea first came when I asked my friend Lisa if she was interested in doing any traveling with me while abroad. The answer was yes and we settled on Dublin, where I had never been and she had family roots, though she hadn’t been there since age 6. She also invited a girl named Maddi to come with us, from her abroad program. Quick side story: while in Segovia, one of the new people I met was a girl named Maddi, who I began talking to. She began asking me questions like “Are you excited to go to Ireland?” and “What do you want to do in Dublin?” I assumed Lisa had just told her of our plans and was taking interest, and so it took me six hours of talking to this girl before having the epiphany that she, in fact, was the same Maddi that was coming with us! Not my brightest moment. Anyway, Maddi had a later flight on Thursday than Lisa and I, so after arriving, Lisa and I headed to a pub called O’Neill’s for some Irish stew and the inaugural Guinness of the weekend. It was a nice, “300 year old” pub with live music and as many beers on tap as you could count. Maddi arrived at midnight and the first words out of her mouth were “I need a vegetable” so we crossed the river to the only thing open: Burger King, for a side salad. </p>
	<p>First up was a day trip to a little peninsula to the north to a town called Howth (pronounced hoat) on Friday. The little fishing village was very quaint and reminded me of Watch Hill, RI. We had some standard fish and chips for lunch before beginning a stunning cliff-side walk around the peninsula. At the beginning of the walk, we found an open beach, where we hung out for a bit. By the way, I’ve made it a goal to touch as many bodies of water as I can, so I added the Irish Sea to the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and North Sea. The scenery was beautiful and we couldn’t have asked for a cooler walk. Unfortunately, it started raining at the furthest point from town, so we had to trudge in the mud for a bit. After the walk, we went to the home of one of Lisa’s long lost relatives for dinner, who was gracious enough to feed us a 5 course meal and host us for 5 hours. She even offered to have us stay over! Her name, by the way, was Agnes Higgins, and she and her husband were wonderful company. </p>

	<p>On Saturday, we headed to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, which was unfortunately closed but still cool on the outside. From there we headed to a delicious brunch place called Brother Hubbard’s. Afterwards, the plan was to go to the National Museum of Ireland, which was a history museum that was free. I was navigating and my phone was in Spanish, so I found on my phone a location called “Museo Nacional de Cera.” I assumed this was it, so we walked there only to find out that ‘cera’ is the Spanish word for ‘wax’. So instead, we found ourselves across town at the National Wax Museum. After that embarrassment, we headed to the Guinness storehouse, which supposedly is the most popular tourist attraction in Europe. Do I believe this? No, but it was cool to learn a little about the brewing process. For example, originally they had to make a stouter version of their brew to ship to Africa, Asia, and South America, in order to survive the further, hotter sail to those places. Also, we got a free pint in the process and the bar where we ate it had a high, 360 degree view of the city. For dinner, we met up with another set of Lisa’s relatives, who took us to a pizza place nearby and were also very nice people. After dining with both sets of relatives, it was very clear that the Irish are a very welcoming people, and that the ties of family are extremely strong.</p> 
	<p>Sunday, we got up early to try to do everything we wanted to finish. We started with St. Stephen’s green, which is a sort of smaller version of the Boston common (by the way, Dublin gave us strong senses of Boston on the whole) in town. We then went to Trinity college, which is a very nice campus, and saw the Book of Kells, which is one of the oldest bibles still around. It dates back to around 800 ad. For lunch, we went to a place called “Little Ass Burrito Bar” which was the epitome of multi-cultural: a Mexican food restaurant run by a Russian woman in Ireland (being eaten by American students studying in Spain). Afterward, we finished the day at the actual National Museum of Ireland, which was a really interesting exhibit on Ireland in the Medieval and Pre-Historic ages.</p>
