	<h2>Skiing</h2>
	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: February 1, 2016</i></p>
	<p>The first weekend after classes started, I went on a ski trip to the Pyrenees. I was invited by a friend named Hannah Schlacter, who I met through Jewish geography. One of the locals (Marcos) who help with her program was driving up to a resort called Baqueira-Beret in the Valley of Aran in the Pyrenees on the Catalunyan side of the border. Its claim to fame is it is where the king of Spain goes to ski. As I didnâ€™t bring ski stuff, I spent several hours in a department store trying to find cheap, DIY alternatives to ski equipment, only to have a local friend tell me I could borrow his stuff. We drove up on Friday afternoon for 6 hours before arriving at our hostel and renting skis. We had an early night after talking over a few drinks and woke up at 8 to hit the slopes. Baqueira was a mountain with very few trees, mostly blue-level slopes, and, this particular winter, little snow. That being said, I really enjoyed the skiing on Saturday, when there were blue skies and 40 degree weather. Sunday was a little more difficult, when it alternated between rain and blinding snow. After a face-first, premium level wipeout on my third run that left me with some badass scrapes, I skied pretty smoothly and felt I picked it back up no problem. Yet the best part were the views over the beautifully jagged Pyrenees. </p>
