	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Berlin</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: March 28, 2016</i></p>

	<p>I arrived in Berlin on the evening Thursday, March 17th. After going through the refreshing process of not going through customs (thank you Schengen area!), I entered to a terminal full of Kippahs, as a flight to Tel Aviv was just boarding. This soon turned out to be a sign of a very religious trip, but more on that later. I took a cab to the hostel and met up with my two traveling companions, Marian and Jeff, at the hostel. Marian is a friend from Tufts who I’ve gotten closer with since we both are studying in Madrid, though we only met about 6 months ago. It was actually her initial idea to do this trip with me— I was going on a run through the Retiro (central park of Madrid) and happened to bump into her, where upon hearing I had no spring break plans, invited me to come with her and Jeff on a whirlwind central European tour through Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, and Bratislava. Jeff also goes to Tufts, yet we had never met before. While I’m still getting a read on him as of this writing, we are getting along just fine and he’s been great to travel with.</p>

	<p>Back to Berlin, Marian, Jeff, and I started off with a walk to the Brandenburg Gate, famous for the speeches of both John F. Kennedy ("Eich bin ein berliner") and Ronald Reagan (“Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall”). The most well-known symbol of Berlin, it was the divider between East and West Berlin during the cold war and represents one of the most political squares in the world to this day. It is flanked by the American, French, British, and Russian embassies, as well as the hotel where Michael Jackson swung a baby from a window. From there we walked to the Reichstag building, the German parliament building. Historically, it’s most famous for the fire that burned it down in 1933, which Hitler blamed on the communists and used as a pretext to begin a political witch-hunt and consolidate power. Architecturally, its massive glass dome is impressive for maximizing the use of natural light and heat to power the entire building, a perfect example of German engineering. After, we stopped by a currywurst stand, classic late-night berlin food, for a late dinner. Currywurst is textbook Berlin, created in the cold war by combining German wurst (hot dog), ketchup from American troops, and curry from British-Indian troops. We capped off the night with a Guinness at an Irish pub to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day.</p>

	<p>For our full day in Berlin, we started with a walking tour, beginning at Brandenburg. Our English-speaking tour guide was actually is Israeli, which was extra beneficial when we got to Nazi locations, as he understood my own perspectives. The first stop was the holocaust memorial, built over the main quad of the Nazi governmental campus. The memorial was simple: 2,700 concrete blocks, each of various heights, shorter on the outsides and taller on the inside, arranged as a grid. The memorial was the size of two football fields and the blocks were at least 12 feet tall at their peak. The ground dramatically shifted in the memorial, which was meant to give the cumulative feeling that civilization was collapsing in on you as you walked into the memorial. Fun fact: the memorial would often be grafittied, so the German government hired a contractor to coat the blocks. That contractor happened to be owned by the same parent company who originally made Zyklon-B, the gas used in gas chambers in the Holocaust. They now supply anti-graffiti coating for free. A man in the group saw me moved by the memorial and was immediately able to peg me as Jewish, as he and his wife were Israeli Jews. Amazing how we can connect even worlds away.</p>

	<p>From there, we went to the location of Hitler’s headquarters, now a mall, and his bunker, now a parking lot. Germany’s government has wanted to leave no opportunity for the Nazi’s to be idolized, to the extent that the bunker has not been touched from decades. Ironically, one country has found their own way to idolize the area: North Korea, by establishing an embassy there. The area also included the Topography of Terror, a museum on the SS and Gestapo located on their former headquarters. It did a good job of explaining the ways SS terrorized the population, but I was most struck by the story of the Lodz ghetto (a special exhibit). In the ghetto was a man named Chaim Rumkowski who was appointed the town elder by the Germans. It was in his power, once the Nazis decided how many were to be deported, to decide which Jews would be sent to death camps and which could stay in the ghetto. In the position of playing god, he attempted to save as many people as possible by sending the sick, elderly, young, and pregnant to their deaths while saving the able-bodied to work in the ghetto. He tried to prove to the Nazis that they could be useful rather than just killed. Besides the unusual and incredible circumstance he was in, I was most taken aback by the image of a Jew with power in the Holocaust. We always think of Jews doing their best to survive or escape or the victims of atrocities, but rarely do we think of Jews who had the ability to influence not just their own destinies but others as well. Yet the summary of the situation was best summed up by the graffiti on a piece of Berlin wall still standing by the museum: ‘Madness’.</p>

	<p>After the Topography of Terror, we headed to the Deutsche History museum, where I was able to find a lot of history on medieval Germany. Yet the museum was as much about continental Europe as Germany itself. Unfortunately, we had to leave before seeing the parts about Bismarck and WWI. That night, we went to a beautiful orchestra concert at ‘Koncerthaus’, Berlin’s historical home for music. We felt the weight of the likes of Wagner, Beethoven, Goethe, Wilhelm, and Hitler as we listened to some Dvorak and Sibelius. We ended the night with a classic German pilsner and a riveting conversation about religion — Marian is a practicing catholic and Jeff grew up in a divided Lutheran and Catholic house, so I think we are an aptly suited group to tackle this area religiously. The next morning, we headed to the Jewish museum, which was an interesting review of Ashkenazi Judaism pre-Holocaust. It was a nice way to wrap up Berlin before heading to the bus to Prague. </p>

	<p>Overall, in Berlin, I was trying to avoid the image of Germany I came in with: industrial, disciplined, and modern. Yet, it was easy to see that image. The parts we were in like a cleaner version of New York and you could tell from street norms that it was very different from Spain. For example, jay-walking is very common in Spain, as it’s completely legal and Spain values the idea of ‘the rules apply to everyone except me’, whereas you didn’t see anyone cross the street outside a crosswalk with a light in. Yet Berlin was a city of great substance, and we loved discovering all of the dense history that occurred there. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but you could feel why Berlin had been so central to so much of modern history. </p>
