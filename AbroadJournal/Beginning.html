	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Beginning</h2>
	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: February 1, 2016</i></p>
	<p>So I think I’ll start this story with the end of the previous semester (fall 2015). Knowing I was going abroad during the spring, I approached the end of the fall semester with a very sentimental and a little morose attitude. In addition to ending a relationship that I enjoyed and that made me happy even if it wasn’t heading towards a long term future, I developed the perspective that my relationship with my closest friends, groups, and clubs would really never truly be the same. They were a social circle on the whole that I had grown very passionate about and in the final days of the semester and even just before I left, I began to think that I may have made a mistake in coming, that leaving my friends and the comfortable joy of my life at tufts wouldn’t be the right decision and that I would never be able to get back what I had. This contributed to an overwhelming sense of emotion that culminated a few days before I boarded my flight with a powerful sinking feeling in my stomach. It didn’t help that I didn’t feel comfortable with the language that I had pledged to speak while abroad and wasn’t confident in my ability to make friends in said language. I think this sense is part of the reason why I put off packing until the last minute and didn’t do much to prepare myself physically or mentally before leaving.</p>

	<p>Yet things got better when I left. The sense of dread I expected to hit me on the plane never came and I enjoyed a comfortable ride in first class for 9 hours to Spain. While I can never sleep on planes, I rested fairly soundly as well as enjoyed a few good meals and a movie. My nerves were eased more when I arrived to find a group of about 7 students waiting for me at the airport, speaking in English. We had all semester to use Spanish, but having a basic introduction to this group in the language I was most comfortable with really did help put me at ease for my trip. We boarded a bus together for the city, where we would all part ways to move into our respective houses before reconvening in the evening. I met my host, Jorge, and his dog, Toffee (or, lovingly, toffito, for his tiny size and fur color, or, less lovingly, loco, for his spastic personality), on the street. In his personal description in an email a few weeks earlier, Jorge described himself as a 30ish yr old theatrical actor. Naturally my mind thought of a young, cool guy who would know the best bars and dance clubs, as well as someone whose shows I would go see. Instead, I found a 45 yr old man with a graying beard and a bit of a beer belly. This is not to say that I didn’t wind up liking Jorge. We quickly got to know each other on the first day with a large lunch and have been getting along fine ever since. Just a different perspective than I anticipated. Jorge is actually, on the day to day, a night manager at a hotel north of the city. He’s gone most nights from 10PM to 8AM, which is fine, because he’s around in the day if I need him, and I have my space at night. My most fun moment with him thus far was when some program friends and I were walking near plaza mayor. A man in a jester costume and white makeup looks directly at us and says ‘hello’ in English. At this point we assume its a weird salesman and scurry past him. Later, at chocolate and churros, Jorge comes to pick me up, only to reveal that he in fact was the jester, doing a scavenger hunt for his hotel guests.</p>

	<p>The orientation process is a bit of a blur to me. As with every orientation for every new experience, it included countless safety briefings and disclaimers, goal setting, and icebreakers, as well as dumbed down versions of what we would need to know for living and studying in the city, as well as tours of important areas. I’ll skip over the mundane details of that and say what stands out in my mind from the first week and a half of my trip. We had an excellent workshop on flamenco, which was mostly focused on the dance/rhythmic element with a bit of theory and history mixed in. My personal background is that I am very big into ballroom dance at tufts with a special passion for paso doble, the dance of the Spanish bullfight, at which I excel. In addition, flamenco has many elements of complex rhythm, of which I acquired a taste in marching band as drum major, as well as guitar and singing, in which I have dabbled. Flamenco was a natural fit for me and I hope to go back and learn more. Another was a walk through a flea market in a neighborhood called La Latina, which is a slightly more rustic looking neighborhood. It was one of the first times our group bonded, but only after a night in several bars and a discoteca that lasted until about 4 am. A cooking class on typical Spanish cuisine was a fun group experience, as was a salsa(ish) club with some program friends. A great night was the Saturday before classes started, when I went to a jazz bar and then a salsa club with some of my closer tufts friends here. This was a great night for catching up with them and teaching some how to dance, which is always a true joy for me.</p>

	<p>I started classes after a week and a half and I was thrown straight into the deep end with my first class: Political Advising. A class for Spanish juniors, I was one of only 3 foreigners in the class and the only who didn’t speak Spanish natively. The teacher spoke in rapid fire, but I was able to hold on and now look forward to interesting discussions and lectures about political marketing and communications about all types of politics, including American. This class has also been the source of the most interesting difference between Spain and the US: the lack of the concept of political correctness. We were told multiple times that this would be a thing here during orientation and I grasped the concept socially when I heard Spanish locals I met skiing (see below) using the word for ‘faggot’ regularly in conversation. Yet in political advising, for an origin story for modern political communication, our teacher decided to show us Nazi propaganda. Not a documentary about Nazi propaganda. A 45 minute video of the propaganda itself. While they were pioneers in the field of modern political communication, it’s hard not to realize that the display of this video in a classroom would simply be unheard of in the United States. Currently, I attribute it to the political correctness concept as well as the lower population of Jews. My other classes seem good. I find my Spanish teacher talented for the first time ever, probably because only the best of the best can teach Spanish in Spain. My culture class should include a nice overview of Spanish culture with some field trips to art museums. My intercultural communication class with the program director, Paco, will be sure to be an interesting take on approaching this experience, with lessons on how to recognize non-obvious differences. Finally, after switching out of an easy class on political institutions to another polisci class with Spaniards on European politics, I think I have a solid schedule.
