	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Budapest & Bratislava</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: March 28, 2016</i></p>

	<p>We arrived in Budapest late at night and walked into exactly what I believed a post-soviet bloc city to look like. The station was dirty and crowded with homeless people, the subway was clearly out of the 50’s and made of steel. There were strip clubs and sex shops all down the street. Yet we found our airbnb with relative ease and were able to practice Spanish when the Mexican apartment owner showed us in. We were happy to get some rest, so he left quickly and we settled in, but before doing so we realized that we didn’t get the wifi password. I went downstairs to try to go to the bar to text him to get the code, thus beginning a great adventure. I realized upon getting downstairs that I didn’t have any money, so I couldn’t go to the bar. I spent about 10 minutes searching the neighborhood for a free wifi hotspot, before giving up and heading to the atm. Three rejected atms later, I finally found one to accept my card and headed towards the direction of the bar, only to find a closed coffee shop with it’s wifi password posted visibly outside. Upon using this wifi, I figured out that my phone had forgotten my what’s app number and the only way to confirm it was by text, which wasn’t possible because I was traveling. Defeated, I headed back to the apartment complex, put my key into the lock, and it wouldn’t budge. Apparently the key we got didn’t quite work. At this point, it was well past 1AM, so I didn’t expect anyone to come through to let me in. Therefore I figured my only option was to try to ring the room on the buzzer system. At this point, I realize I never knew our room number, so I proceed to ring every door on the third floor, briefly, so my awake roommates would hear it but not the sleeping neighbors (this strategy didn’t work, as a neighbor came out mad and yelling, according to Marian and Jeff). Yet, they didn’t hear me either, so I realized my only other option, given there was no way to contact them, was to play dead and hope they would get worried and come find me, so I waited for 20 minutes outside in the cold until a guy in a different airbnb happened to walk in and let me in. What a process! I was determined not to let this experience beat me, so we went back out as a group with a working key and used the cafe’s wifi to text the owner before watching 21 jump street late into the night.</p>

	<p>We slept in the next morning, for the first time after 10 days of packed-schedule traveling. We awoke and checked out the cafe where we found wifi the night before, which had delicious quesadillas as we planned our Budapest excursions. We decided to start with the Old Synagogue, the largest in Europe. Once home to Theodore Herzl, the majestic building was also a site of the mass graves of Jews killed by Nazi-inspired fascists in Hungary in 1944. From there we headed to St. Stephens Basilica, the central church of the city, which was easily the most beautiful we saw on the trip. In some way, it felt fuller and grander than the rest, perhaps because there really wasn’t a narrow part of the church, unlike most. We spent sundown at Buda Castle, the home of Hungarian royalty that had an interesting exhibit about the medieval castle and its uses. Yet the views were unbelievable from the cliff and it reminded me how wrong I had been about my initial image of the city. It was, in fact, as stunning as any we saw and a reminder that their history was much more than just the cold war. From there, we found a traditional Hungarian restaurant where I got a traditional dish: fried cheese. We actually found this first in Prague, but we figured one of us had to try it and I was happy to take one for the team. Across the street was a tea place our friend Harry recommended, who is studying abroad in Budapest but was traveling that weekend. To cap off the night, we headed to a famous ruin bar, which is a sort of hipster/kitschy kind of dive bar.</p>

	<p>The following morning we went early to the famous baths of Budapest. It was a huge complex of pools, spas, thermal baths, massage rooms, saunas, and steam rooms. We explored a bit of everything (except for the massages, because they cost more), but it was striking how popular they were, and not just a tourist trap. Even on a Saturday in March, everybody was heading to the baths to the extent that it was hard to find pool space sometimes. At 1:45, we arrived at Parliament for a tour. The day before we had realized that all the English tours were booked, so luckily we were able to find a Spanish tour in the middle of the day. One of the cool things traveling with others who spoke Spanish was that we could break into the language if we wanted to, including for tours and if we wanted to be less understood in a heavily English-speaking place like Berlin. The parliament building put both Vienna’s and the U.S. Capitol to shame, as it seemed more like a palace than a parliament and might have been the most ornate building in the city. After dropping off our wet clothes at the apartment, we did some souvenir shopping and walked up the main tourist area to an Easter market, where we ate a quick dinner that was essentially a large, flat latke with chicken and peppers on it (not sure if this was traditional food, but it sure was good!). Back when we were getting recommendations, we were talking and one of our friends recommended a wine tasting and another a “booze cruise.” Marian responded with my favorite Spanish saying “¿por que no los dos?” ("Why not both?"). We were able to find a wine tasting on a river cruise boat for not too expensive and we were able to try seven different kinds of Hungarian wine of all types while getting the nighttime views of the city from the river and being serenaded by a string quartet. We capped off the night by buying the dessert wine we really liked from the cruise and playing cards into the apartment (by the way, the dessert wine was once called by Louis XIV of France: “Wine of Kings, King of Wines”).</p>

	<p>We woke up early Sunday morning for Easter mass. Marian, while not as religious now, grew up devoutly catholic and was really interested in seeing a mass while there, so we headed back to St. Stephens Basilica for a 10 AM service. For me, I learned simultaneously a ton, as it was my first mass and I was able to discern a lot of rituals, but also nothing at all, because the entire service was in Magyar and didn’t understand a single thing said. For a while, Marian was able to whisper a play-by-play, until an old lady in the row in front of us shushed us. I think this was quintessential to my church experience. I tried my best to be an active observer while not kneeling or praying myself. It was funny, for the first prayer, the ended it with an “amen” and, out of instinct, I responded “amen” before realizing I should probably bite my tongue. Overall, Budapest might have been my favorite city, just because it so greatly beat my expectations. Besides being very cheap to get around, we found a lot of history, culture, and entertainment there.</p>

	<p>We had less than 24 hours in Bratislava, but I feel like we made a good experience of it. We stayed at a little place called the Wild Elephants hostel, which was super friendly and somewhere I definitely wish we could have stayed longer. We spent our evening there walking around the city, seeing the castle at sunset, and getting some basic food and drinks before returning early to pack and get some sleep. What we loved about Bratislava was its unpopularity. We only went there to get a cheaper flight out, yet we realized while overlooking the city that we were taking the road less traveled, which was how we liked ending two weeks of tourist hotspots. When I told my mom I was in Bratislava, she responded “Where’s that?”, which is probably what most people will respond when I tell them about the trip. It’s ironic, because, as the capital of Slovakia, a country that for years desired its own independence and fame outside of Czechoslovakia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, they must have thought that their independence would have brought that name recognition. Yet I’m happy to say I went. </p>
