	<h2>Family Visit</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: April 30, 2016</i></p>

	<p>Dad, Mom, and Jennifer arrived in Madrid to visit on the 22nd of April. Jennifer had school off for Passover, so they were all able to come for the week. Sara, unfortunately, still couldn’t come, as she reminded us frequently. When they arrived, we all were very happy, as it had been the longest period of time I had gone without seeing my family. They surprisingly were awake and functional, so we decided to walk around the neighborhood. After showing them Jorge and I’s small apartment, I took up Calle de Atocha to Tirso de Molina, my favorite square in Madrid. We had a coffee and snack at two different cafeterias on the square while catching up about our flights and trip. We walked back through Lavapies, a multicultural neighborhood, to take a quick rest and nap at the hotel. That nap turned into most of the afternoon. Jennifer woke up not feeling very well, so she decided to skip the Passover Seder we had planned for the evening. We had found a Seder with the reform/progressive Judaism community in Madrid, which was a really nice seder. We met up with my friends Regina, from CIEE, and Bernie, a tufts friend visiting from London for a few days. The seder was similar to what we would do at home: we combined a loose following of the order with comments about modern-day relevancy, social justice, etc. The meal itself was also delicious and we really enjoyed meeting the mix of americans in Spain for the time and Spanish Jews. </p>

	<p>On Saturday, it was a beautiful day, so we all got up early and headed to the Retiro, the beautiful park that I just can’t stay away from. The original plan though was to start with a crepe place near the park, however, strangely, the crepe place was closed for Breakfast, so we got some other breakfast food at a nearby cafeteria. We couldn’t have spent a better day at the park, and took a slow, leisurely stroll through. We stopped at the pond to rent a row boat and paddle around for about an hour. We decided to go back to the crepe place after, where for some reason I was compelled to get a Burger crepe. Not that it wasn’t good, but not exactly the crepe you’d expect. From there we decided to head back for a much shorter rest before heading back out to the Reina Sofia, where I figured it’d be good to show the family the Guernica. Unfortunately, my friends in my culture class didn’t send me their notes on the other paintings I was supposed to see in that museum after I missed our field trip for Morocco. So we walked in, saw the Guernica, and walked out. Dinner that night was at a restaurant in Malasaña, where I introduced Mom and Jennifer to tinto de verano, a game changer for both of them. We also called Sara, who was still mad at us for going on vacation without her. We all at some form of tuna and I was the only one who enjoyed the entree itself, but the cheese platter we started with was universally loved. We finished the night with some chocolate and churros.</p>

	<p>On Sunday, we went to the Rastro, the major outdoor flea market in Madrid on Sunday mornings. As one does at the Rastro, we bought nothing, but we did look at everything on sale. I decided to get work done for the afternoon, as I had a major project and a final exam the next day. We met up for dinner with Jorge around Callao around 9, where Jorge could go straight to work after eating. Before the dinner, I remember telling my family that I wasn’t sure if Jorge spoke English. We had established a pattern of only speaking Spanish in the home, so besides a few confusing words, it had never occurred to me that he spoke English. Boy was I surprised when he broke out speaking PERFECT English to my family!!! I guess I’m glad he hadn’t told me that he had studied in Ireland for a year and a half and spent a summer in England, because it forced me to practice my Spanish more in the home. Anyway, it was nice talking between them: there are so many things that I had just never asked him or had never come up, that he had been taking voice lessons while I’m in classes or that he was thinking about putting on a new theater production. The food itself was delicious and we ate all of it family style with lots of delicious seafood, fish, and vegetables. I was up late that night doing my work, so I didn’t get much sleep. The next day, after working almost all night, I presented my project on the New Zealand Flag referendum in my political marketing class. It went fairly well and I came across competent but I couldn’t relax, because I had an hour and a half to cram for my Spanish exam at noon. Relaxed, my last class of the day, intercultural communication, was just a trip to the Palacio Real.</p>

	<p>Back story time: that April marked the one-year anniversary of Jennifer’s brain surgery. It had been a long road to recovery that I’m not going to talk about here, but Jennifer had decided much earlier that she wanted to go to DisneyWorld to celebrate the occasion. When we planned this trip, we decided that she would go with my parents to Disneyland Paris instead. They would go during the week, as I had classes and had to study for my exams. Then my Tuesday and Wednesday classes were either cancelled or deemed skippable, so a week before the family arrived I decided to join them in Paris for Disney for the anniversary. Thank goodness I did, I was glad I was able to be a part of that celebration. I flew up after the Palacio on Monday night. As I flew in, I looked and saw a spotlight lighting the way. It took me a minute to realize it was the Eiffel tower. Welcome to Paris, Adam! After my cab ride in, my family was waiting for me with some flan from their dessert. We headed to bed pretty quick, as we had a big day the next day.</p>

	<p>We woke up early the next day because we had a character breakfast to get to before the park opened. We hailed a cab to the commuter station that would take us to the park, but bizarrely, the cab driver didn’t know where the biggest train station in the city was. So he drove around until we gave up on him, jumped out, and found a metro to the station. Being late to the breakfast wasn’t bad, it was just a buffet and they still had our table. Jennifer’s reaction to seeing everything was priceless. We went to Disney a lot as kids, but while Sara and I were able to understand everything that was going on, Jennifer just got one big, romantic memory of our trips there. That, combined with a genuine love all things Disney and princess made this the only place in the world she would want to spend this anniversary, even at age 16. We were visited at breakfast by Mickey and the gang. We were so happy it didn’t even bother us that the food was terrible! We had been to Disney so many times that we didn’t even have to talk about what our plan was: we went up Main Street USA straight through the castle to the Dumbo ride, without a word of what to do first. It wasn’t that Dumbo was our favorite, it was just that we knew it would get really slow within an hour of the opening. What I didn’t remember was all the trombone-heavy marches that they play in the line, which I loved and recognized. We spent the morning going through the snow-white-like story rides before going to my favorite ride: Buzz Lightyear! My dad and I matched up yet another time and this time I won! We walked out and saw that space mountain had a wait of only 5 minutes! So Jennifer decided to get into line before she could let herself acknowledge she doesn’t like roller coasters. This space mountain was much more intense than the one in Orlando, with loops and corkscrews of all kinds. A quick note about the weather: that was the craziest day of weather I had ever experienced: we cycled through snow, rain, sleet, sun, clouds, and darkness. It was miserable at times, but gave us the advantage of virtually no lines. Anyway, we finished out the rest of the attractions, including the Phantom Manor, with much-less-scary French voiceover, and a Johnny Depp-less Pirates of the Caribbean ride. One interesting thing was a performance that they had from a bunch of characters. The interesting thing was their selection of songs: they chose from Tangled and more modern movies rather than the Toy story and Lion King I was used to seeing. In this moment, I realized that Toy Story and Lion King were modern for me and that for the 6 year olds running around the park, Tangled and Frozen were as solid of a part of their Disney lexicon as Cinderella. Anyway, we finished our night with a nice (expensive) character dinner, where Jennifer got to meet the princesses. After a very long day, we headed back to Paris. </p>

	<p>We woke up the next morning and Jennifer and Mom went out for facials and shopping, while Dad and I stayed in the hotel until we met them for lunch. We were in a rush to get to the airport, but we found a LaDuree where we could get macaroons for the road and stopped quickly by an ice cream store we loved last time called Bertillon on the middle island. I was sitting separate for the flight, where I caught up on some work. We parted ways at the metro because I needed to study for the Spanish culture exam I had the next day. I studied late again, and woke up the next morning and felt fairly good about the exam. Meanwhile, my family went to Segovia for the day. We met up that night for dinner at a Chinese food place we went to the last time we were in Madrid. We got, among other things, a fish for dad, whole, with the eye still in it. We called Sara from the walk home. After we got back, I met up with some friends for drinks, so the next morning it was a little rough to get up and over to the hotel for breakfast. Yet it was okay, because we still made it to Escorial in time for our day trip there on Friday. </p>

	<p>El Escorial is a monastery an hour to the northwest of Madrid, famous for being the burial site of all of the royal family of Spain. We arrived around noonish and headed straight to the monastery, where got audioguides (which were terrible, as each track droned on an on for much longer than it took to see a given room. We sort of stumbled upon the room with the caskets of the kings and queens, or at least we didn’t understand the sign. I looked up and saw ‘Carlos III’, who is the namesake of my university, and was like ‘oh, these are the kings and queens’. Other features included a set of apartments where King Philip II could literally go to mass in the adjacent church from bed and a mass tomb for all the royal children who died before age 5 due to inbreeding and bad medicine. After the monastery, we went for a late lunch, where we had some ambitious Spanish food, including a seafood paella (this was advertised as a fish and veggie paella, so we were upset when there was shrimp in it), cooked artichokes in olive oil, and an extremely daring chicken soup alongside tinto de verano. We walked off our lunch and then got a cab back to the station, where we walked around while waiting for our train. After resting upon getting back, we headed to a more hipstery restaurant in Malasaña called La Mucca, where we got chicken fingers, cheese fondue, pizza, and a salad with beers. We met up with Jorge after for more chocolate and churros to hang out before he went to work again. Mom had never opened the box of chocolate mix that we got from this place last time, but that didn’t stop us from getting more. We finished off the night by walking to a bar where some of my friends were hanging out, as Mom and Dad had been practically begging to meet my friends. The family stayed for about 10 minutes before we said our goodbyes for a month, as I stayed to hang out more with my friends and they went to sleep. Jennifer had a big social night planned after getting back from the flight, so she had to rest up. But regardless, it was great seeing them, and I miss them a lot already!</p>
