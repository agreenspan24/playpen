	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Italy</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: May 13, 2016</i></p>

	<p>Our train went from Interlaken to a nearby town called Spiez, to Milan, to Genoa, where we were headed. It was an uneventful trip for the most part, but I did continue my pattern of sleeping hard with my mouth open on trains and planes, so the good news is I may be getting a reputation of it. We arrived in Genoa and walked through the overgrown and disorganized but strangely charming streets, up a massive hill with our luggage to the hostel. Genoa and Interlaken were beautiful in opposite ways: Interlaken because it was pristine, Genoa because every inch had character. We got pizza that night, and let me tell you, it may not have been the best pizza I’ve ever had, but it was perfect. Every ingredient I really like (olive, anchovy, mushroom, onion, and capers) as a menu option, plus the sauce was surprisingly good for something so light. We walked around the port after and headed to bed after. </p>

	<p>For our full day in Genoa, we mostly walked around town: the morning was the old town, where the streets were more like alleys and you would stumble upon a church every other block. We stopped at a quick Ethiopian food place for lunch and spent the afternoon towards the outskirts on the coast in a little neighborhood called Bocadasse. We got some gelato and sat on the beach for a while before heading back. We cooked our own dinner that night, again to save some money, and this time it turned out great, because not only did we have a fully stocked kitchen at this hostel, but the veggie burgers we ate were pre-made. The next day, we went to the Museum of the Sea, where we saw a lot about Christopher Columbus (who grew up in Genoa), old Italian galley ships, and sea monsters: it was a fun museum. We boarded a train towards Florence, which had a transfer in Pisa. We tried getting out at the station to see the leaning tower, but, alas, it was not visible.</p>

	<p>We arrived in Florence around 4 and were picked up at the train station by Maddi’s friend Jessa, her good friend and housemate from the previous semester. We walked with our bags through town, before I split up with them to check into my hostel (Maddi was staying at Jessa’s). That afternoon I met up with my friend Claire, who I realized upon seeing her that I had not seen her since graduation night. It’s funny: she was someone I was decently close with in the band, but we had never made a point of seeing each other over the breaks and weren’t in the same friend groups. But it was nice to see her, catch up, have some gelato, walk the town, and swap abroad stories. I definitely left the conversation more inspired to catch up with the other friends I haven’t seen in a while when I get back. Anyway, afterward Jessa, Maddi and I walked up a hill to watch the sunset from a big overlook of the city. We made our own dinner that night, definitely the best of the three: pesto pasta, zucchini pomodoro, and fried eggs that didn’t break in the pan. </p>
	
	<p>For our full day in Florence, Maddi and I went to il Duomo, the major cathedral with a massive Dome, while Jessa was taking an exam. I knew a surprising amount about il Duomo beforehand for two reasons. First, Dan Brown’s Inferno talked a lot about it. Second, when I took an Intro to Architecture class the last Fall, il Duomo was the only thing we covered before I dropped the class. The Dome itself was designed by a local who single-handedly started the architectural renaissance by being the first one to do a Dome since the Romans. Anyway, we climbed up to the top, where it was raining lightly but we could see most of the city. Florence was charming and beautiful, plus you could really tell every street had a history. It was the center of the Renaissance and a mecca for art and culture for many years, and that had certainly left its mark. I’m not sure if I had seen a city that felt that cultural since maybe Paris. From there, we met another of Maddi’s college friends for lunch at a panini place, which was most certainly worth it. From there, we met up with Jessa and headed to the Palazzo Piti, a palace of the famous Medici family. Once extremely wealthy, they were the sponsors behind, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Machiavelli, and so many more, and their house embodied their artistic and political importance. It was filled with art and jewelry and fine clothing, plus their gardens were massive and cool looking. Maddi and I fell asleep from tiredness in the gardens, but eventually got up as they kicked us out. We headed back to the apartment for a bit before going to a pasta place that evening, where I got some Delicious gnocchi in cheese and truffle oil. The plate was literally boiling when it got to me, but that, accompanied by the wine, was easily the most satisfying meal of the trip. </p>

	<p>Our flight the next morning was at 12:30, so Maddi and I met up, did some souvenir shopping, where I bought a Florencian-leather wallet, before heading out to the airport, thus beginning a saga of epic proportions. Upon arrival, we realized our flight was at 3, not 12:30, so we had to wait around for a few hours until the ticket booth opened, because I had forgot to print my ticket. We went to security, where they told Maddi that she had not print a ticket but rather a receipt, so she had to go wait in the 40 minute line that I had just waited in, and suddenly we were running late for our flight. We managed to get through in time to get a slice of pizza before boarding, but when we went down to board, we discovered that all flights out of Florence had been cancelled. We later found out it was due to “wind”. So, we had to go back out to the front desk, outside of security to await any news. The airport, which was tiny, only had two staffers, so Iberia, the airline, would have their headquarters rebook all our flights. This meant that the two staffers had no idea what anybody’s plan/flights were. This didn’t stop all 100+ passengers from jumping at them and demanding answers, which made our line to get a snack voucher for while we waited last an hour. Meanwhile, they still had no information for us, so we made friends with some other American students in line with us. after 4 hours of waiting, no news, and our wifi codes running out, we decided to head to a cafe across the parking lot to de-stress. The information desk said that they would contact us as soon as they knew anything, but of course, no information came. When we got back after 45 minutes, we found out that everyone had all been sent to a hotel, but had not been rebooked yet. The two staffers decided that this, when they finally knew something, was the perfect time to take a break, but before doing so said to us, just go to the hotel on the bus with the others, and that they would contact us and tell us what to do from there. So we went to the hotel and got a room, ate dinner and talked with our friends, all the while checking our phones for emails or texts from Iberia constantly. None came by 12:30 at night, so Maddi and I decided to get up early in the morning at 7, so if we got the message overnight, there would be enough time to get to the airport for the 10:20 direct flight to Madrid leaving the next morning if we got assigned to it. At 2 am, I got woken up by a friend next door watching a movie and noticed that he had texted me saying that he had called Iberia and they had told him that he had been rebooked, even though he never received a message from them. So I called the number, yet I still had not been rebooked and was told to go to the airport to talk to them (which was not possible and I didn’t think would be successful). I went back to bed and woke up at 7 and still had not received a message, so I went back to bed, as I was exhausted. At 8, Maddi was up with me, no message had come, and at this point she suggested I ask the hotel if they knew anything. The hotel said, “I’m sorry sir, we don’t know anything, you have to ask the airline.” But then they said “But we do have this list of everyone’s flight assignments here.” THAT WAS THE THING WE NEEDED!!!!!!!! Exasperated, I ran downstairs (it was 8:20 am) and found out that we had been rebooked onto a flight to Barcelona (with an unknown connection) at 9:45 am. Completely not packed, we threw everything in our bags and ran downstairs and begged some old ladies on our flight to share their taxi to the airport. They obliged and we got to the airport, where the check-in line was very long and slow. Luckily, they asked for anyone else going to Barcelona, so we got to skip the line and got to the plane just in time to board, an hour after figuring out we had a flight! It was a little difficult, but we were able to find our tickets to Madrid in Barcelona fairly easily and were back in town by that afternoon. But had we not gone to the front desk, we would have never known we had new flights, as, contrary to everything they told us, Iberia did not contact us. I would say I’m not going to fly with them again, but I’ve already booked a flight with them to France for later this month.</p>

	<p>Traveling for a week with just one person was interesting. Maddi and I had not been good friends before leaving, and frankly I probably wouldn’t have gone had I known it would have been just us for that much time. There was an awkward period in the middle where I wasn’t sure if she had a crush on me (I wasn’t interested, as I was seeing Zoe back in Madrid), which made the dynamic difficult before we established a better relationship where our feelings about each other were more clear. But we wound up coming out of the trip quite close. I suppose if you spend that much time with someone, you create a pretty strong bond regardless of the circumstances. And she was a great travel companion: relentlessly positive and relaxed, even with difficult situations, and was adventurous and fun. The trip itself was wonderful and a great way to see the region. The trains were as useful as the stops themselves, but I loved Italy and Switzerland and hope to go back soon.</p>
