	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Lisbon</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: April 17, 2016</i></p>

	<p>Emily and I had been planning on going to Lisbon for some time before heading out on April 14th. A quick word about Emily, since as of this writing she somehow has not been mentioned. Emily and I are ex-ballroom friends and was my closest friend going into our study abroad trips. We had gotten closer after she found out she would be on the Tufts-Skidmore program and I on CIEE last fall. She remains one of the people I hang out with the most, the person who I go to practically every dance related thing with, and a very close friend. So she and I got on a plane that Thursday, waiting for Marian to meet us there the next morning. Emily and I arrived late at night and found our hostel, which was the closest to a dorm I had been in since. Marian arrived the next morning and we had the free crepes provided by the hotel for breakfast. While having breakfast, I overheard at the next table an American complaining about republican Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, so I naturally jutted into the conversation. I found out he was an Indiana U. student studying in France. We planned hanging out later, so we exchanged facebooks. One look at his mutual friends and I exclaimed: "oh, you’re Jewish!" The mix of 10 mutual friends were a combination of my Jewish friends at IU, people involved with NFTY nationally, and a pair of YJ people. What a small world!</p>

	<p>or its pastries and monastery. It was pouring rain as we waited outside for monastery tickets, but we got in and saw a beautiful building and church in the manueline style (cue inside joke). We found a traditional Portuguese restaurant outside for lunch (kind of meh here) and got some famous Belem pastries for dessert next door (delicious!). Before heading back towards the main area, we climbed this massive monument to the explorers. It was certainly over the top and probably a bit disrespectful to all parties involved, but the views were excellent and we enjoyed the suddenly clear skies. We found a bus to take us back to the old town, and the first thing we found was a cherry liqueur apparently famous to the area. I never thought I could possibly dislike a cherry liqueur, but it seems I will not be going back for that one. From there we got lost climbing a small hill that led to the Prague Castle, a middle-age castle that was interesting to see. Slightly bored from the content of the ruins, we decided to have some fun by playing Mad Libs with the guide book. History has never been so bizarre! The castle itself though was home to some outstanding looking peacocks, as well as some nice views of the city. We walked back down the hill to the main square, where we took some beautiful pictures as the sun set. For dinner, we had received two different recommendations: the first was a place called Cerveceria Ramiro, which was supposed to have very good seafood. We weren’t given the name of the second but we were told it was a famous restaurant with a line for an hour out the door. Upon arriving to Cerveceria Ramiro, we realized they were the same, so we went down the street for another seafood place that had no wait. We capped off the night by walking through the area of town with the bars before stopping in at a place with live jazz. After one glass of porto wine (native to Portugal) we all collapsed on the table and headed back to the hostel, where we informed my new friend that we simply did not have the energy to go out that night.</p>

	<p>On the docket the next day was Chefchaouen, more commonly known as the blue city, as most buildings are painted blue to repel bugs and reflect heat. It was up in the mountains, which were beautifully green and steep. It was mostly a place for pictures, but one striking element was the Jewish quarter. Apparently both Chefchaouen and Tangier had thriving Jewish populations, especially after Jewish expulsion from Spain and Portugal. It’s funny how this heritage keeps popping up everywhere I go. While medieval Judaism of course was tragic and difficult, you can see why Jews were so successful and commerce, because you could see how a Jewish merchant could find members of the tribe everywhere he travelled. It must have been interesting to be one of those merchants and be able to interconnect with different communities and gain a global perspective when nobody else in that age could do so to the same extent. After some souvenir shopping, we headed back to Tangier. The three CIEE people and I searched for dinner, which was funny, because while we were walking, the Real Madrid v FC Barcelona game was on. As we crossed every restaurant, every eye was glued to the game as the mostly male population was seated around the TV, including every cook and waiter. We wound up finding a place with a TV to eat and watch, where the 60 or so people in the restaurant reacted madly to every play. We then went for a walk on the beach, which was a little trashy and under construction while building a Miami-style beachfront, but a nice place to talk and share stories. We woke up the next morning and headed to the old town market of the first day for a while before heading back to the ferry and bus. We are, as of this writing, expecting to get back around midnight on a Sunday, just in time for a turnaround for my 9 AM class.</p>

	<p>The next morning we slept in a bit before heading to the train station, where we grabbed a train to nearby Sintra, where there were some excellent mountains, castles, and views. It was a difficult process of traveling, as we hadn’t really planned ahead for train schedules, area maps, or things to do. But after we got situated in Sintra, we headed to a Moorish castle, which was mostly abandoned, just the walls and stairs were left, but had some great views of the landscape. From that castle, we could see miles all the way to the Atlantic, an hour away by car. The other major attraction was the Pena Palace, which was a bright, multicolored palace in the mountains. We walked the grounds and explored a bit of the woods outside for some cool rock formations and old outdoor tables (see my sacrificial altar photos). We had dinner in the small town, which was delicious! I had some fish and chips, made with local fish. Yet Marian had the top dish- a lima bean stew with some meats and potatoes that had a to-die-for richness of flavor. Anyway, we headed from dinner and found this small street in a neighborhood with a lot of big houses but no tourist attractions. From there, we could see the sun set over the Atlantic and countryside. It was probably there we all discovered our mutual love of dancing, and we danced to shakira in the glowing red light. After, we headed back to Lisbon, where we found a loud but small bar with a rock band near the hostel. We sipped some more porto over some very deep conversations about our lives, romances, and music. Our flights were early the next morning, so we turned in early and headed to the airport as the metro opened, taking the first train out. Our flight was fairly smooth and we got back to Madrid with enough time to have decent days on our own.</p>
