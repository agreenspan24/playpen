	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Sevilla & Lyon</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: May 29, 2016</i></p>

	<p>I had really wanted to go to Andalucía while studying in Spain, yet May came around and I still hadn’t gone, so I decided to book a trip to Sevilla for directly after my exam. I had also wanted to travel alone at least once, just to have a trip that was completely and totally my own, where I could see if I could make it with my own plans and thoughts and language and traveling abilities. So after finishing my last exam in Marketing Política, I headed to Atocha station for a train down. The ride was fun; it was showing  “The Fault in our Stars” in Spanish, which I was gratified to know I understood fully in the other language. Though there were definitely parts I could tell wouldn’t play in Spain. Like the PDA scene, which was purposefully over the top for the US, but was barely noticeable in Spain. This was a recurring theme for movies in Spain. Deadpool, for example, didn’t play as well because they punned so much on English and referenced so many things that were exclusively American. Yet I arrived around 4:30 and headed to the hostel, dropped off my stuff, and headed out to walk the city. Striking was the Plaza de España, which was the massive plaza used in Star Wars. It was kind of in the middle of nowhere, it’s not like it was surrounded by buildings or a usable plaza for anything besides tourism. The reason why plazas in Spain were so useful was that they were impossible to avoid: streets led to them, they were in the center, important buildings surrounded them. But the Plaza de España was gorgeous and had these really cool little slots in the wall dedicated to every city in Spain. I took a picture by Madrid’s. From there I walked through the lush park nearby and along the river, before heading towards the Cathedral. Along the way, I heard bugles, and followed the sound until I found a marching drum & bugle corps going down the street. I later found out they were part of many events for Dia de Corpus Christi. Anyway, the Cathedral was cool, higher vaulted than usual, and more packed, as there were exhibits flocked by tourists and locals alike. From there I walked up to get a quick dinner of gambas al ajillo before going to a Flamenco show. It was really cool to see Sevillanas, the type of Flamenco that’s a partner dance. As usual, it was improvised and amazing to see all the subtle cues they gave each other to indicate the next step. Also cool to see a powerful male Flamenco dancer. I walked around some more and found a celebratory band concert in a plaza and listened a bit before walking around the city and eventually heading back to the hostel. The next morning I went to the Alcazar palace, which was super cool and had a mix of Muslim and early Christian influences. The gardens were also really beautiful. From there I walked to something called La Seta (mushroom), which was a market with a cool roof with an overlook of the city. I ate lunch there, ran into a bit of the day’s procession, and went into another church that was having another band concert. After that, I headed back to the Cathedral and climbed its tower, before heading back to the hostel, packing up, and finishing my whirlwind tour of Sevilla. Overall, it was a city with style, not just character, and its diverse history was clear walking around. I enjoyed traveling alone, and would like to do it for some more time, to really spend time in my thoughts, but I think I still prefer traveling with friends. </p>

	<p>I didn’t have much time back home, because the next morning I headed to Lyon. I headed to the train station to pick up Madeleine, my ballroom partner who I hadn’t seen in over a year. She had taken a train in from Tubigen, Germany, where she was studying. We headed to a restaurant in the mall next to the station because we couldn’t yet go to the airbnb. We chatted and caught up. Though we had been talking regularly throughout the semester, we still hadn’t spent time together, so we spent the lunch filling the gaps in our memory. We walked slowly through the city towards our airbnb, only to find out our host still wasn’t back, so we headed down a major street, got a s'mores frappuccino, and did some shopping (we both hated it but did it anyway because we needed things) before Sarah arrived from her train from Talloires, France. We met up and headed to a restaurant recommended to Sarah by her abroad program. I got an interesting sampler platter of what I want to see were lentils, sausage, and octopus. The meal was less fun, as the Andouille sausage I ordered wasn’t very appetizing. We walked back to the airbnb, met our hosts, who barely spoke English but were very nice. That night we decided to try to go to a salsa club, as you couldn’t keep these dancers off the floor. We headed to a first place, which was empty and expensive, and another that required me to have pants, which I didn’t have. So we decided to walk along the river. With the exception of a tense moment when some rowdy youth who were drinking threw a bottle poorly aimed at the river and actually hit Madeleine, we had fun, danced, and dipped our feet in the water. We collapsed getting home. </p>

	<p>The next morning, Madeleine and I slept in till 11:30, while Sarah had woken up early on her own and went out and bought us some goat cheese, brie, jelly, and baguettes, which we had for a small but delicious breakfast. From there, we headed towards the old area of town, down some nice streets on the center peninsula, to the old Cathedral, parts of which dated back to the first century AD. From there we walked up a massive hill towards the basilica, which sat overlooking the city. The walk up was full of gardens and passages, plus some nice graffiti that was addressed to “Adam”. The Basilica itself was probably the most beautiful I’ve seen: simply stunning in every way. There wasn’t a single spot not covered with art or decoration. The overlook as well was incredible. We walked back down and eventually found some fish and chips on the cheaper side for lunch. We then decided to go shopping: I needed pants if we wanted to go dancing that night. But as usual, it turned into a hunt for clothes for Sarah and Madeleine that, while ultimately were good finds for them, were not necessary and took over two hours to find. I meanwhile ran into a small store and got European jeans, which are no fun: no pocket space, every size built for someone 6 feet tall, and hard to wriggle in to. After we dropped our clothes off, we decided to ride bikes up to an old Roman amphitheater. It was up a massive hill that we had to walk the city bikes up, only to find that the amphitheater was somewhere else. So we rode to the park that was next on our agenda, which was closed. Tired of the bikes, we dumped them and ultimately walked to a restaurant near the airbnb, where we got a serious dose of veggies that were very good. It was raining, so we ran back to the room to get umbrellas before heading to the salsa club. We enjoyed dancing for about an hour, but we were extremely tired and there was a surplus of creepy old men, so we left a little early to chill at the room before bed. The next morning, I had an early flight, so I packed up and ate the remaining cheese and bread with them before heading to the airport.</p>

	<p>Two major conclusions came from this weekend. The first was about targeting. From Madeleine getting hit with a bottle to a drunk man on the street trying to kiss both of them to the old men at the salsa club trying to get too close, I was starkly reminded of how threatening a life of a girl my age can be. These incidents, combined with their mention of more serious encounters, which I shall not mention here, made me think a lot about how these kinds of actions by my fellow men can ruin the experiences of my female friends and my relationships with them. These repeated encounters have eroded a basic trust between people. It’s so much harder to make a friend when they are worried that I’m a threat to them. I’m finding it hard to express here, but this weekend pushed me to acknowledge the serious affects that predatory actions have on my life and the lives of my friends. The second was about good friends. Yes, it had been months since I had seen Sarah and over a year since I’d seen Madeleine. But as true good friends, it was as if nothing had really changed. We all had more stories and had to catch up on what we had missed, but when we were hanging out, it felt totally the same, despite the time, distance, and change of circumstances. I suppose that’s the sign of a good friendship. Also, Madeleine and I are much more similar than I had remembered. </p>
