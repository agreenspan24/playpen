	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Prague</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: March 28, 2016</i></p>

	<p>We arrived in Prague around 9 PM and headed to our airbnb. Fun story: Jeff had been texting back and forth with our host, who kept sending him back responses with winky faces. That, combined with an ambiguous profile picture, led us to believe that she was flirting with him. We kept joking that Jeff should wink at her when we got to Prague and keep flirting back. So to our glorious surprise, our host walked out to let us in and turned out to be a man! Marian and I completely lost it as we walked up the stairs to the apartment. We decided to wander and found some cheap pizza for a late dinner and went to a hip basement bar to chat for a bit, where we got an interesting shot called a B-52, which is a combination of Kahlua, Bailey’s, and Absinthe — delicious and strong!</p>

	<p>The next day we met Marian’s high school friend, Rachel, who had been studying in Prague for the past year. She showed us around the entire day and served as a valuable translator for a language none of us could speak. We started the day in the old square, which featured an Easter fair, where we grabbed some mulled wine and a Czech street food standard that was essentially a slinky of dough covered in cinnamon sugar. On the square was the Old Town Hall, which featured an impressive astronomical clock and a tower we later climbed for stunning views of the city, and two churches. The latter was the Church of St. Nicholas (yes, that St. Nicholas), where we were able to later to go to a lovely brass quintet/organ concert in the historic church. From the square, we walked down the river to see the old and modern theaters, aka Rachel’s meccas given she’s a theater directing major (just like Sara). We ate goulash- essentially beef bits, bread dumplings, and gravy sauce- for lunch and a Pilsner which originated in Pilsen, Czech Republic. We spent the afternoon taking a boat ride on the river, where I would have heard a lot of information about the city had I not fallen asleep. We spent sunset at a church and former fort up on a hillside with great views of the city and the grave of Anton Dvorak, Bohemia’s most famous composer. After a nighttime walk up the river, we dined at a boat-Italian restaurant on the river.</p> 

	<p>The following day, we were Rachel-less but managed to still make it around. We started by crossing the Charles Bridge, famous for its old statues, to a bagel shop where I got my favorite meal: bagel with lox and cream cheese (which I hadn’t eaten since getting to Europe!). We walked up to the most touristy spot of the city: Prague Castle, which remains to this day the seat of the Czech presidency. Its most prominent feature is its cathedral, which has some very intricate stained-glass work and the tomb of St. Wenceslas, the patron saint of Bohemia. We saw the window where the defenestration of Prague occurred- the throwing of several rulers out the window that started the Thirty Years’ war. Last was a smaller basilica, which might have been the oldest church I’d ever seen, standing since the 9th century. Crossing back over the bridge, we went back to the old town square to see the Mucha exhibit of art, a Czech painter famous for his Nouveau Art movement in France. The paintings were mostly delicate, sexually drawn women that were used for posters and stamps. The Jewish Quarter was next, where we saw the oldest synagogue I had seen, from the 12th century. It’s most famous Rabbi, Rabbi Loew, supposedly created a Golem to protect the synagogue. It was plain but the center bimah was barred off from the rest of the seats, which was new to me. Also new to me, women’s seating being located in a completely different room as the men, with thick walls in between. After the concert at St. Nick’s that night, we tried the local liqueur, Becherovka, which we really liked, at a very loud British bar, and stayed there chatting late into the night. The next morning, we did some souvenir shopping before heading to the bus station for Vienna. </p>

	<p>Overall, Prague was a beautiful city, a storybook image. If you covered up a few elements, you could easily have been walking around in the 1500s in some parts. It was also a nice contrast from Berlin’s heavy history lessons and industrial city. Even though Prague is actually a heavily-populated city, it felt like a small town and we had a nice time there. </p>
