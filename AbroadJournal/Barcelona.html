	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Barcelona</h2>
	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: February 21, 2016</i></p>
	<p>The following weekend was an organized CIEE trip to Barcelona. While I went to Barcelona last time I was in Spain with the family, I enjoyed the trip with the 20 people on my program, with whom I’ve enjoyed spending time with. It didn’t hurt that CIEE was fronting most of the cost of the trip. Barcelona is a highly multicultural/international city and the heart of Spain’s tourist industry, so it wasn’t uncommon to hear a wide array of languages, especially English, in the city’s restaurants, clubs, and attractions. We left on Friday by bullet train and arrived at our hotel in the mid afternoon. The hotel was located on Paseig de Gracia, a posh and famous street in Barcelona known in part for its Gaudí architecture. Gaudí’s work is iconic to Barcelona for it’s funky shapes often like shells or fish or other natural life. I relished in telling my friends the fact I had learned last time, which was that Gaudí’s inspiration was often shrooms and other drugs. We went into an apartment he built on the street, which had great views of the city. Surprisingly a three piece orchestra was playing from the balcony of the building and we enjoyed a nice set before continuing on. That night we walked down La Rambla, a bustling market street, to the shore, where we ate at a food court on the water.</p>
	<p>Later, a smaller group of us went to a bar where we talked and played games. One particular game I’ll mention is one I definitely plan on bringing back to other friends and want to remember the rules here, which is called “Text or Drink.” The gameplay is simple: all players put their phones into a middle pile. One person randomly grabs a phone from the middle and types a message to somebody in the phone. The message can be on any topic to anyone except parents. After they finishing typing, but before hitting send, the typer asks the phone’s owner “text or drink.” If the owner says ‘text’, the typer sends the message and the owner cannot say anything to the recipient to clarify for four hours. If the owner says ‘drink’, they have to drink. The goal of the typer is to get the text sent, so they have to write something funny enough to be interesting but safe enough to be sent.</p>

	<p>On Saturday, we began the day with a trip to the Sagrada Familia, a cathedral that is the masterpiece of Gaudí. Still under construction, Gaudí insisted that the cathedral be completed on ‘God’s schedule, not his own’. Construction began in the late 1800’s and is not scheduled to be completed until 2026, which itself is a controversy because the local government is pushing to complete it soon rather than in the way Gaudí originally intended. Nonetheless the church is a breathtaking piece of art that has been significantly updated since last I was there. It was also a gorgeous day and we got some great pictures of it. </p>

	<p>From that cathedral, we went to another cathedral, the stadium of the FC Barcelona soccer team. Arguably the best team in the world, fans from all over came to worship at its feet. One particular man was standing next to me at a highlight reel, squealing with his hands over his mouth and commenting excitedly to me in rapid Chinese. The stadium was massive and sat 98,000 people, which in my experience has only compared to the Cowboys Stadium in Dallas. The team’s slogan is (translated) “More than a Club,” a nod to their history as the symbol of the Catalan identity. For years, the region in which Barcelona sits, Cataluña, has been in a fight with the capital over independence and autonomy. There, they speak Catalan, have some different customs and traditions, and are fiercely nationalistic. Even now, the primary factor preventing a coalition from forming after recent elections is the issue of a Catalunyan independence referendum, which his highly divisive. FC Barcelona, with its rivalry with Real Madrid (the symbol of centralist power from Franco through now), has been the rallying point of nationalists. It is no accident that, in this Spanish club, no Spanish flags could be found and the exhibits were presented first in Catalan, then in English, then finally in Spanish.</p>

	<p>Also, my friend Jacob and I went exploring the city that night, which was very cool to see the Gothic area at night, only to be caught in a storm. When it started, we dived under a restaurant awning, only be told that they were retracting it. We were then forced to run at least a half mile to the nearest subway stop, drenched in the only clean clothes we had left. On Sunday, we celebrated with the locals a Saint’s festival, which featured a parade of very silly costumes, a dance in front of the old cathedral called the Sardana (which is simple and hora-like, mostly with old people), and watched a very cool human tower building contest (which was amazing to see 6 year olds climbing up to the level of 7 people.</p>
