	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Switzerland</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: May 13, 2016</i></p>
	<p>We flew into Geneva on a Thursday night and arrived late, so we headed directly to the hostel. The public transportation was not only nice and free, but we stumbled upon a major UN building at night, which was once the headquarters of the League of Nations. After dropping off our stuff, we walked around the harbour of Geneva (which is situated around a big lake) before going to bed. In the harbor, as a side note, was a massive, white swan, right in front of us. It seemed sort of symbolic of the majestic trip we had ahead of us, so I took a picture of it and mentioned it here. The next day we woke up and headed down to the free breakfast, where we met in line some nice girls from Michigan who were traveling here after school ended for them. We had a nice chat and breakfast with them, and it established a pattern of future encounters. Anyway, that morning Maddi and I walked around the old section of Geneva. It was a pristine and gorgeous town. Switzerland on the whole felt intentionally picturesque: there was hardly ever any trash around, sites were situated with a beautiful view of their surrounding nature, and the city was always laid out with a certain charm. Anyway, that afternoon we boarded a train to Bern, where we would connect to Interlaken.</p>

	<p>The train ride was nice, partially because I got to teach Maddi how to play Gin, but mostly because of the views. The ride gave us STUNNING views of the Alps, which were showing their best for us: green on bottom, snow-capped, and with a beautiful, mostly clear blue sky behind them. It would have been perfect had it not been for a baby that decided to wail the whole way there. Anyway, we arrived in Interlaken, dropped off our stuff, and decided to buy some snacks for the hike we would take later that afternoon. After buying some goldfish that were actually pretzels and the best peanut butter on this side of the Atlantic, we walked to the base of the mountain on the outskirts of Interlaken. A quick side note about Maddi: this semester she’s been having some stomach problems. Essentially her digestive system has been highly slow and she’s been backed up on the other end. This was a central theme of the trip, as she needed to eat, but never could eat very much, and would sometimes spend a bit of time in the bathroom. This manifested itself especially on our first hike. We decided to climb this mountain, yet shortly after we began, Maddi needed a rest. This kept repeating itself every few minutes, and the sun was already going down, so we realized we weren’t going to make it all the way up to see the sunset. We did get a third of the way up the mountain and we were there to see the place, not to climb, so we headed back down and took a lift up to the top, where we could see the whole town from the observation platform. The town itself was really beautiful. As its name suggests, Interlaken was situated between two turquoise lakes, a small town mostly there for tourism. It was, in some sense, exactly what you’d expect from the Epcot version of Switzerland, which was weird because you didn’t think anybody actually constructed houses like that anymore. The town had so much character that even the construction sites, trains, and garbage dumps contributed to part of the pretty picture. We were regularly stunned by Interlaken and had to pause every once in a while just to take in its beauty. Anyway, at the top of the mountain, I needed a hot drink, and oddly enough the only hot drink they had was fruit punch (spelled “punsch”). Weird. We headed back after the sun set, where I got some Doner Kebab (10 freaking euros!!!) and we headed to bed. </p> 


	<p>The next morning, we got breakfast at the hotel and headed out to a place on the western lake where we could rent kayaks. After much searching, we found the place and kayaked around the lake for a while. I wanted to jump in, but after feeling the water, I thought it would be better to just drink the water instead, which was perfectly drinkable, by the way. We were out for about an hour before we decided to go back and nap. We bought food to cook our own dinner to save money. In this moment, I got the brilliant idea of trying to find a place for a bratwurst. After searching for over an hour and walking the entire town, we eventually found one, and it was awful. Easily the worst part of the trip. Yes that includes the flight home that I’ll mention later. Anyway, from there, we went to rent bikes for the afternoon from the cheapest place in town: the Kebab place we went to the previous night. I have no idea why they rented bikes, but they did and I got a nice, therapeutic ride throughout the town. That night we cooked some objectively poor eggs and pasta and hung out with our new roommates: a combination of groups of girls from the U.S. and Canada. They were nice and we chatted into the night before heading to bed. </p>


	<p>The next morning, we did the cheapest adventure activity available to us (as the fun paragliding and whitewater rafting were around $200): a ropes course! We didn’t have much time, as we had to get to our train, but it was super fun and challenging! It was incredibly high up and strenuous, but it was easily a highlight of the trip. After, we bought some Swiss chocolate and souvenirs, took one last good look at the beautiful town, and headed out.</p>
