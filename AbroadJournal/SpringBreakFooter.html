	<h3>Reflections on Spring Break Part I</h3>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: March 28, 2016</i></p>

	<p>As I fly back to Madrid while writing this, I have a few reflections on the trip and Central Europe as a whole. The first thing that hasn’t gotten mentioned was Doner Kebab. A magnanimous presence on every street we saw, Turkish food has permeated into every culture. The Ottoman Empire once reached all the way to the gates of Vienna and that influence still existed through the Kebab stands on every corner and the coffee, introduced by Turks but now the most popular drink there. And as Europe gets increasingly Muslim, Turkey’s bid to the EU is considered, the Brussels attack occurred while I was here, and as all the countries I visited talk about taking in migrants and refugees, it’s important to mention just how big of an influence Islam already has on the region.</p>

	<p>The second is begging. I first noticed this in Vienna, where beggars on the street were prostrated and bowed at the feet of pedestrians, heads down and not making eye contact, as if asking the King for mercy. This stands in stark contrast to everything kind of begging I’ve seen thus far. American beggars are marketers, perhaps shaking coins or holding signs and other beggars in places like India or Morocco actively approached those who they thought could help them, yet that juxtaposes the strategy taken here where the most humility seemed to be the form of getting support. I tried to hold back at my own disgust and appreciate the tradition in some way, fighting back the urge to say my own cultural perspective and say that homeless people have dignity and should consider themselves no lower of human beings than anyone else and should not have to prostrate themselves to gain the sympathy of their fellow man. Yet my intercultural training here told me to recognize that the American way is no better than any other. What this taught me was about their societal view on hierarchy and the ingrained ideas of difference between people of various social classes.</p>

	<p>Another was language. In this area, more than Spain and much more than the US, it was mandatory to know more than one or two languages. While my image was skewed because I was dealing with people used to tourists, it was clear that it was not uncommon to find people who were tri-lingual or quadrilingual. From a cafe owner in Bratislava outside the tourist area to a waiter in Vienna who spoke at least 6 languages, even outside the tourist bubbles there were people who spoke English fairly well. I guess when you live in a part of the continent where the language changes every few miles that’s what happens. Regardless, English seemed to be the lingua franca of tourism in the area, which was helpful to us mere mortals that only spoke 2-3 languages.</p>

	<p>This spring break trip was most certainly a marathon. We were packing a lot of sights into short days and the whole trip was very ‘go go go’. I was glad we got this ‘sampler platter’ of central europe, as we wound up calling it, yet I hope to revisit some of these places with a more relaxed pace later in life. If there’s anything Madrid has taught me thus far, it’s that you can’t experience or understand a place in only a few days. While that was never the goal, there’s something to be said for a trip more like the one I spent in Mumbai or even Dublin, where you talk to locals and get to know how people live and think and not just go to the museums and historical sites. Nonetheless, I am incredibly grateful for the ability to have done this trip and am so blessed to have been able to expand my worldview this way. </p>
