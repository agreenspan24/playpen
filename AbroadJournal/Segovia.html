	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Segovia</h2>
	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: February 21, 2016</i></p>
	<p>Segovia was a day trip to a town about an hour north of Madrid. Situated in the mountains, we arrived with some light snowfall, which was about 10 degrees colder than Madrid. I traveled with a total of 8 girls, all of whom were on the Tufts/Skidmore program, not the CIEE one, where I go. Some of them were new people who I was happy to meet and I was welcomed openly into their group. We began the day by taking a train, then a bus, to the center of the city. Segovia is famous for a Roman aqueduct that was constructed in the first century AD and stands about 5 stories tall! Aqueducts were used to transport water at this time from place to place, making areas previously uninhabitable or arid habitable or farmable. They were an architectural marvel at the time and to this day are on the euro as a symbol of the original interconnectedness of Europe. This one was located in the heart of town, yet we were able to climb up some stairs to get to the top to get some truly spectacular views of the massive structure. </p>
	<p>From there, we traveled up to the old cathedral through, ironically, the old Jewish area of town. Not much remained of the Sephardic Jewry in that town. Nonetheless, a little golden marker with the word “Sephard” written in Hebrew shaped into the shape of Spain was a nice reminder of my roots here. The cathedral, as most cathedrals in Spain are, was a massive enterprise of the gothic era. Luckily, I took three lessons in architectural history last semester before lightening my course load, so I was able to tell that the pointed arches indicated a slightly younger church (post 1200 AD) and an architectural breakthrough at the time. It was not quite as nice as the one in Toledo (which is Segovia’s rival to the south that I would still recommend if one only had time for one), but it was still impressive and enjoyable, like the city in which it stood. </p>
	<p>Before leaving for Spain, I got a very nice message from my elementary school friend, Diego Arguelles, with whom I had not spoken with for years and who had many recommendations of where to go from his time living in Spain. One of his recommendations was a Segovia restaurant that served a local delicacy called “Cochinillo.” I was all for going until I mentioned it to the group, who informed me that it was a whole, fried, baby pig served on a platter. The two vegetarians in the group promptly rejected the offer and we went for paella instead. The final stop of the day was in Segovia’s castle, which is famous as the inspiration for the castle in the Disney symbol. Unfortunately, the towers were covered due to maintenance, but I will certainly enjoy the feeling we got when we stood in the exact throne room where Christopher Columbus petitioned King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella for ships to sail originally West to the Indies. After a scenic walk around the city, we headed back.  </p>
