	<h1>Abroad Journal</h1>
	<h2>Morocco</h2>

	<p class="WrittenOn"><i>Written On: April 3, 2016</i></p>

	<p>Barely 72 hours after returning from spring break to Madrid, I packed my bags once again and headed to a bus station to take an overnight bus to Morocco. Backing up, about a month and a half before, some friends and I were tossing around the idea of going to Morocco over spring break. It was a big goal of mine while abroad to see Morocco, so I was happy we were in fact able to make the trip happen for a weekend as a group of four from CIEE. The trip itself was organized by Citylife Madrid, which is a company that caters to foreign students with parties, cultural events, and social exchanges as well as trips. As a side note, I feel guilty when going to city life things (which is rare) because I know it’s not the best way to get a truly Spanish experience. Yet there are some things one does not pass up.</p>

	<p>Our overnight bus arrived in Tarifa, Andalusia, Spain around 8 AM on Friday morning, where we got breakfast at the port before heading on a ferry to Tangier, Morocco. The first thing I noticed about the Strait of Gibraltar was how easy it was to spot the two sides. On each side are hulking mountains that make the strait a lot closer looking than they actually are. In fact, from the shore, the strait seemed swimmable, which the 45-minute boat ride proved would be impossible. After dropping off our bags at the hotel (yes, this was a hotel not a hostel, thank the lord!) and grabbing a quick lunch at the restaurant nearby, we headed an overlook called Cape Espartel. At that beach we went camel riding, which was interesting to say the least. For one, the camel’s weird legs made mounting and dismounting strange as the camel would jolt forward and backward while standing up with you on it. Luckily, my years of bull-riding training as a Texan prepared me for this! The ride was funny as the camels were all roped together, so my leg kept getting squished by the camel to my right who couldn’t walk straight and my foot was right by the rear end of the other camel, which was a suspenseful game of will he or won’t he go to the bathroom while walking. Let's just say it was not the long walk on the beach I had imagined! From there we went to the Hercules Cave, which is a bit of a misnomer, given Hercules (a myth) never actually went there. The story goes that Hercules, as one of his labors, was sent to retrieve an apple from the garden of the Hesperides. Supposedly in Tangier, he actually retrieved a Tangerine, which is named after the city. Yet the cave itself had an interesting view of the Atlantic and was actually carved out by the Phoenician empire. The program then took us to the old town’s market area, where we went to a weaver’s who showed us their 19th century loom and an herbalist, who sold essentially a lot of natural makeup and 'health’ products. We finished the day at a touristy restaurant, but it was a good and traditional meal with some local musicians. </p>

	<p>On the docket the next day was Chefchaouen, more commonly known as the blue city, as most buildings are painted blue to repel bugs and reflect heat. It was up in the mountains, which were beautifully green and steep. It was mostly a place for pictures, but one striking element was the Jewish quarter. Apparently both Chefchaouen and Tangier had thriving Jewish populations, especially after Jewish expulsion from Spain and Portugal. It’s funny how this heritage keeps popping up everywhere I go. While medieval Judaism of course was tragic and difficult, you can see why Jews were so successful and commerce, because you could see how a Jewish merchant could find members of the tribe everywhere he travelled. It must have been interesting to be one of those merchants and be able to interconnect with different communities and gain a global perspective when nobody else in that age could do so to the same extent. After some souvenir shopping, we headed back to Tangier. The three CIEE people and I searched for dinner, which was funny, because while we were walking, the Real Madrid v FC Barcelona game was on. As we crossed every restaurant, every eye was glued to the game as the mostly male population was seated around the TV, including every cook and waiter. We wound up finding a place with a TV to eat and watch, where the 60 or so people in the restaurant reacted madly to every play. We then went for a walk on the beach, which was a little trashy and under construction while building a Miami-style beachfront, but a nice place to talk and share stories. We woke up the next morning and headed to the old town market of the first day for a while before heading back to the ferry and bus. We are, as of this writing, expecting to get back around midnight on a Sunday, just in time for a turnaround for my 9 AM class.</p>

	<p>Overall, Morocco was striking. For one, the use of hijab and burqa by Moroccan women was interesting. Most women, including young women and even girls wore hijab. Most women also didn’t walk outside alone and many girls my age were seen almost exclusively walking with boyfriends. There was a noticeable difference in the way men interacted than the U.S., as men were often not afraid of personal contact, even among strangers. It reminded me of the relations I see in among orthodox Jewish men: since they cannot touch women and homosexuality as a concept is taboo, they affectionate with each other. Morocco itself was clearly developing and on the rise, but you could also see the underdevelopment in sanitation and construction. Street commerce was interesting, where we were regularly approached by people begging for money or trying to sell us hashish, opium, or marijuana. Haggling was the norm, the water was not drinkable, and there was a distinction between tourist and local institutions, though we experienced both. An interesting element was drinking culture. As it is illegal in strict forms of Islam to drink alcohol, we saw virtually no bars outside the hotel and we even saw a TV ad for a non-alcoholic beer. We pondered, but did not figure out, how the combination of drinking and gender norms affected nightlife. Language was again interesting, as everyone spoke French in addition to Arabic (Morocco was a French colony), and many spoke English and/or Spanish. This proved its enduring interculturality as an intersection of the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Yet, the most striking element was its complete lack of ‘African-ness’. Many on the bus there said ‘We’re going to Africa!’, yet when we got there, it almost entirely aligned with my images of the Middle East, not (sub-saharan) Africa. Besides skin color, the population was entirely Muslim, followed Arabic traditions, and had pan-Arab television and brands. While it may show how my images and worldview can be skewed, I come away still believing I have never visited ‘Africa’. </p>
