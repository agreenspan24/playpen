<div id="Biography" class="container-fluid">
<h2>About Chris</h2>
<p>Chris Murphy is a U.S. Senator from Connecticut.<br><br>
Chris was first elected to Congress in 2006, defeating 24-year-incumbent Nancy Johnson by running a positive, grassroots campaign. Since his election to Congress, Chris has maintained a constant presence throughout the district when he’s not representing Connecticut in Washington. Chris’ attentiveness to his constituents is well known – an article in a Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call, said that Chris is “considered ‘omnipresent’ back home” due to his commitment to knocking on doors year round and holding dozens of supermarket office hours. 
<br>
  <div id="demo" class="collapse">
In Connecticut and in Washington, Chris’ career has centered on his strong advocacy for better, more affordable health care. In Connecticut, he served as Senate Chair of the Public Health Committee in the General Assembly for four years, authoring Connecticut’s Stem Cell Investment Act and the state’s landmark ban on smoking in the workplace. During his second term in Congress, Chris was appointed to the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee where he took part in the drafting of the historic health care reform law. As the legislation moved through Congress, Chris was a leading voice for the public option and putting Americans back in charge of their health care. 
<br><br>
Chris’ great-grandfather and grandfather climbed into the middle class through jobs at Fafnir Bearing Company in New Britain, and his family history has caused Chris to become a firm believer in the imperative of keeping manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Toward that end, Chris founded the Buy American Caucus, a bi-partisan Congressional group dedicated to ensuring that U.S. industrial policy incentivizes companies to create jobs here at home. 
<br><br>
Since his days as a student activist, Chris has been committed to the issue of environmental protection, and he currently sits as Co-Chairman of the Congressional Land Conservation Caucus. This position has allowed him to advocate on behalf of the many wonderful open spaces and natural treasures the 5th District of Connecticut has to offer, such as Skiff Mountain in Kent and the Farmington Valley’s Metacomet Trail. 
<br><br>
As the son of a public school teacher, Chris believes that education is the key to the future of our nation. In Congress, he has looked for diverse ways to improve our nation’s classrooms, from strengthening efforts to improve our traditional K-12 classrooms to supporting education in our high performing charter schools. 
<br><br>
Throughout his time in public service, Chris has fought for equal rights and protections for all Americans – no matter their sexual orientation or identity. He has advocated for the federal government to abandon the Defense of Marriage Act, supported legislation to end employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and fought to end the military’s ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy toward gays in the military. 
<br><br>
Both sides of Chris’ family go back four generations in Connecticut. Chris grew up in Wethersfield, Connecticut, where his parents continue to live. He attended Williams College in Massachusetts, graduating with honors, and received his law degree from the University of Connecticut. Chris currently resides in Cheshire with his wife Catherine, a legal aid attorney, and their sons Owen and Rider.</p>

        <div class="panel-body"><p>Chris believes in common-sense ways to grow businesses and get people back to work in Connecticut.&nbsp; He developed his approach by listening to Connecticut&#8217;s employees and employers: </p>

		<p><b>1. Simplify the tax code</b>: We must reform the tax code for individuals and businesses to encourage growth and to get rid of loopholes that put small businesses at a disadvantage</p>

		<p><b>2. Promote and strengthen American manufacturing</b>: Our economy can&#8217;t survive unless we make things here - and our government should support this effort</p>

		<p><b>3. Reinvest in our transportation infrastructure</b>: We can rebuild our roads and rails while putting Americans back to work</p>

		<p><b>4. Make education a priority</b>: We won&#8217;t be the cheapest place to build things, so we must be the smartest</p>

		<p><b>5. Lead the way in renewable energy</b>: Renewable energy is the next big global industry, and we must work now to ensure those jobs stay in the U.S.

        <div class="panel-body"><p>The war in Afghanistan has taken a turn for the worse in recent years, largely because of a lack of attention by the previous administration which instead turned its attention to Iraq.&nbsp; Insurgent activity has surged and suicide bombing - a tactic previous unheard of in Afghanistan - have taken its toll on the war effort and the hearts and minds of the Afghani people. Once thought vanquished in the wake of the coalition invasion, the Taliban has since regrouped into a powerful and canny insurgency, launching record numbers of attacks on foreign troops.</p>

		<p>I believe we need to refocus our efforts in Afghanistan to stifle the drug trade, work with tribal leaders to suppress the insurgency and help bolster the country&#8217;s flagging economy.&nbsp; On a recent trip to Afghanistan, I was told by an Afghani official that a truck transporting agricultural goods from northern Afghanistan to the border with Pakistan will be stopped, on average, 27 times by bandits and government officials seeking bribes. This is unacceptable, and has to change in order for Afghanistan to become stable.</p>

        <div class="panel-body"><p>I support health care reform because I believe that quality, affordable health care coverage should be a right, not a privilege available only to those who can afford it. I truly believe that a national system of health care can insure every American and cost us less than our current bloated and inefficient “sick care” system.</p>

		<p>As the former Chairman of the Connecticut Public Health Committee, I have made the fight for increased access to health care for the people of Connecticut my defining mission as a public servant. In the State Senate, I wrote and passed legislation banning smoking from the workplace, ending overly aggressive bill collection practices by health care providers, and investing in low cost prescription drug programs. In 2005, I authored Connecticut’s landmark Stem Cell Investment Act - making Connecticut a leader in the push to find new cures for some of our most debilitating diseases.</p>

        <div class="panel-body"><p>I believe all children deserve an opportunity to attend quality public schools and to be taught by quality teachers. A sound system of public education is not only America’s promise to its citizens but the foundation of its economic prosperity. </p>

		<p>We need to be able to compete in a global economy. In recent decades, we have been witness to the rise of the Asian economies, enormous global capital transfers, and the increasing internationalization of production. To create the highly skilled workforce required in this environment, our education house must be the very best in the world.</p>

		<p>None of the things I’ve talked about will happen if Republican-led efforts to cut support for K-12 and higher education come to pass. At a time when the middle class is most vulnerable and education has never been more important, it’s critical to ensure that Connecticut elects a champion for public education.</p>

        <div class="panel-body"><p>We have made a promise to our veterans, and I will always uphold my part of fulfilling that promise. This nation has sworn, as Abraham Lincoln said: “to care for him who shall have borne the battle.” Therefore, no veteran should go a night without a bed or a day without the best medical care, and I have spent my time in Congress focusing on exactly that. My office has helped hundreds of Connecticut veterans get the benefits they earned by working diligently with the state and federal Departments of Veterans&#8217; Affairs. Whether it is helping to navigate a disability claim or recover a lost or stolen medal, I am always ready to use my office as an advocate for Connecticut veterans. </p>

		<p>One of my first actions in Congress was to reaffirm my commitment to adequate veterans funding. I immediately helped pass the largest funding increase in the 77 year history of the Department of Veterans&#8217; Affairs (VA), reflecting our commitment to increasing access to healthcare, improving benefits and streamlining case management. </p>
